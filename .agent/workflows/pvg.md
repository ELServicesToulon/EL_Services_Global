description: Push, Versionne, Git
---

This text describes a workflow to be followed after a task is completed. It's a set of instructions for me, your assistant, to perform:

clasp push: Upload the local Apps Script files to your Google Apps Script project.
versionne l appscript en conservant l url: Create a new version of your Apps Script project while ensuring the web app or API URL remains the same.
synchronise avec github: Synchronize the code changes with your GitHub repository, likely by committing and pushing the changes.
In short, after I finish a task, I should ask you if you want me to deploy the new version to Apps Script and save the changes to GitHub.
