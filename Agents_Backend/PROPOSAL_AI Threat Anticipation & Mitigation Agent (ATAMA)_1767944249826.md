# 💡 Proposition de Nouvel Agent
**Nom** : AI Threat Anticipation & Mitigation Agent (ATAMA)
**But** : Proactive security agent identifying and mitigating potential threats to EL Services' logistics/transport operations before they impact service delivery and revenue.
**Justification** : ATAMA provides exponential value by preventing revenue loss and service disruptions *before* they occur. By proactively identifying vulnerabilities and automating responses, it minimizes the impact of cyberattacks, system failures, and even physical threats (e.g., supply chain disruptions). Preventing even a single major incident can save significant costs and maintain customer trust, leading to exponential improvements in overall reliability and security posture. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities can inform strategic planning and resource allocation, optimizing resilience and minimizing potential future risks.
**Fonctions Clés** :
- Vulnerability Scanning & Prioritization: Continuously scan all systems (applications, infrastructure, vehicles) for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, prioritizing remediation based on risk level and potential impact.
- Threat Intelligence Integration: Aggregate and analyze real-time threat intelligence feeds to identify emerging threats targeting similar logistics/transport systems.
- Anomaly Detection: Monitor network traffic, system logs, and application behavior to identify anomalous patterns indicative of malicious activity or system failures.
- Automated Incident Response: Trigger automated responses to identified threats, such as isolating compromised systems, deploying security patches, and alerting human security personnel.
- Predictive Threat Modeling: Use machine learning to predict potential future threats based on historical data, current trends, and external factors (e.g., geopolitical events, weather patterns).
- Supply Chain Risk Assessment: Evaluate the security posture of key suppliers and partners to identify potential weaknesses in the supply chain.
- Real-time Geolocation Risk Analysis: Analyze geolocation data from vehicles and drivers to identify potential risks related to route deviations, unauthorized access, or suspicious activity.
